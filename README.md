You have to work on the Dogs adoptions dataset.

It contains three files:

dogs.csv, shortly dogs
dogTravel.csv, shortly travels
NST-EST2021-POP.csv

Notes

It is mandatory to use GitHub for developing the project.
The project must be a jupyter notebook.
There is no restriction on the libraries that can be used, nor on the Python version.
All questions on the project must be asked in a public channel on Zulip.
At most 3 students can be in each group. You must create the groups by yourself.
You do not have to send me the project before the discussion.
